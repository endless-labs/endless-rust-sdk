/// Breakdown of fee charge and refund for a transaction.
/// The structure is:
///
/// - Net charge or refund (not in the statement)
///    - total charge: total_charge_gas_units, matches `gas_used` in the on-chain `TransactionInfo`.
///      This is the sum of the sub-items below. Notice that there's potential precision loss when
///      the conversion between internal and external gas units and between native token and gas
///      units, so it's possible that the numbers don't add up exactly. -- This number is the final
///      charge, while the break down is merely informational.
///        - gas charge for execution (CPU time): `execution_gas_units`
///        - gas charge for IO (storage random access): `io_gas_units`
///        - storage fee charge (storage space): `storage_fee_veins`, to be included in
///          `total_charge_gas_unit`, this number is converted to gas units according to the user
///          specified `gas_unit_price` on the transaction.
///    - storage deletion refund: `storage_fee_refund_veins`, this is not included in `gas_used` or
///      `total_charge_gas_units`, the net charge / refund is calculated by
///      `total_charge_gas_units` * `gas_unit_price` - `storage_fee_refund_veins`.
///
/// This is meant to emitted as a module event.
///
